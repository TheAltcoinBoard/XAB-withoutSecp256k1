
XAB - The official currency of TheAltcoinBoard.com

TheAltcoinBoard.com, initially launched on March 18, 2016, implementing the idea of a cryptocurrency related discussion board,
which rewards the registered users for sharing their thoughts,  ideas, and opinions about different crypto related topics.
Being in association with PostCoin, gave the core of the whole concept, since the users were rewarded with AltcoinBoard tokens,
which they were able to exchange into PostCoin and then withdraw.  After a successful launch of PostCoin, with the initial free
distribution, TheAltcoinBoard.com userbase started to grow from day-to-day. To ensure and maintain the development of
thealtcoinboard.com project, we decided, by mutual agreement, to separate our ways and drop the PostCoin project,
and now AltcoinBoard is to release a coin dedicated to the forum.
